description: MaintainableCSS 的介绍, 实现编写模块化，灵活， 可维护的 CSS。
---

MaintainableCSS 目标是编写模块化，可扩展，可维护的 CSS。这个指南不仅仅解释*如何*去做，更多的是解释*为什么*要这么做。

## 无需下载

这不是一个库或框架。It's a set of principles, guides and conventions to help you write CSS for small or large-scale websites.

## 可维护是什么意思？

Maintainable CSS can be defined as being able to make styling changes, without worrying about accidentally causing problems elsewhere.

## 可扩展是什么意思?

Scalable CSS means that as CSS increases in size, it's still easy to maintain. If you've ever inherited a large CSS codebase, and been afraid to make changes, you'll sympathise with this.

## 模块化是什么意思?

A module is a distinct, independent unit that can be combined with other modules to form a more complex structure. In a living room, we can consider the TV, the sofa and the wall art to be modules, all coming together to create a room.

If we take one of the units away, the others still work. We don't need the TV to be able to sit on the sofa etc. In a website the header, registration form, shopping basket, article, product list, navigation and homepage promo can all be considered to be modules.

## 这适合我吗？

If you've ever experienced pain when writing or maintaining CSS, then you'll find useful information in this book. And if you work in a team, this book can serve as documentation for you and your team.

## 这学起来难吗？

No. You can read this in under 20 minutes which includes the rationale behind the approach. Implementing it takes less than a minute.
